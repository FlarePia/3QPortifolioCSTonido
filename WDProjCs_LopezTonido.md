# 3rd Qtr Update Proposal

### What kind of HTML will we use and how will we use it?

- Our website will use a Login/Sign-up HTML Form that appears automatically as you open the website
- This form is for users to be able to access the website and to customize their profile later on
- There will also be a choice for users to check the “Remember Me” box to save login information.
--------------------------------------------------------

### Purpose of the HTML Form:
- Identify users who are using the website.
- Save the user’s information on their computer.
- Enable users to customize their profile and be on the leaderboard for the minigames.
--------------------------------------------------------

### What information will the HTML Form collect?
- Username
- Password
- Email
- Favorite Unstable Universe Character
--------------------------------------------------------

### How will the data be saved?
- The user’s data will be saved on their computer using JavaScript: localStorage
- When the user logs in, their username, password, and email address will be stored locally
- One thing to note is that since this website is made by us (simply Grade 9 Students), we do not have the capacity to create a website that can securely store passwords
- So the way these information are stored are for educational purposes only, and show how these data will be used across other pages.
- The login page will no longer reappear unless the user logs out or the user does not press the “Remember Me” box.
--------------------------------------------------------

### How will the data be used?
- Display the user’s information on the Profile Page.
- Show the user’s username and ranking on the Leaderboard Page.
