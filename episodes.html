            game years ago. However, they have seemingly returned to our server.</p>
          <p class="ep-full">So with the help of my friend and mentor, JamatoP, I learned how all the exploits worked
            and gained access to things like bedrock, barriers and command blocks which shouldn’t even be possible. This
            left me to be hunted by Wemmbu who was doing his best to prove that I was exploiting. However, when I
            suggested we use this to our advantage, Jamato refused to work with me and decided to leave as he never
            wanted to be associated with the exploits ever again.

            safe haven for any player trying to escape. We would gain members for this civilization, create strong
            defenses and assist players in need. But eventually, after defending this city for so long, we were ambushed
            and had no choice but to leave this city we’ve made behind.

          <p>The MAFIA is after me. If I don’t give them my exploits, then they will destroy everything I love. Will we
            be able to survive the relentless invisible hunters with the help of our new friends? Or will I give in and
            reveal the exploits to Ash. </p>
          <p class="ep-full">When Mapicc and I were chased by Mafia members, we were saved by this powerful player named
            MinuteTech who wanted nothing to do with us after helping us escape. But we eventually pestered him enough
            to get him to help us.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            While Mapicc and I went on our own mission, Minute had given us coordinates to traps and an emergency
            location if we ever needed it. However, when we got jumped, Mapicc was captured. So Minute and I decided to
            form a team of our own to fight against the mafia. However, the teammates I invited weren't exactly up to
            Minute’s standards.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            Nonetheless when we got Ash’s coords, we fell into a trap, surrounded by a hundred invisible players,
            leading Minute to sacrifice himself, allowing us to run. A few days later, we (Planet and I) were confronted
            by Ash and were hit with the harsh reality that Minute had been indoctrinated into the mafia to survive that
            1v100. But when all felt lost, I found a book from Jamato telling me what he had sacrificed to keep me safe
            with a compass, the one item that could save the entire server.

            So after kicking Dean out of the team, Wifies and I move forward to the farlands. But once we were so close,

          </h3>
          <p>The Mafia has terrorized our server for weeks. However, after finding their secret base, we knew there was
            only one way to save our friends. We decided to go undercover and sneak into the ranks of the mafia. </p>
          <p class="ep-full">There seemed to be a diamond trim (highest rank) watching our every move, but we decided to
            ignore it. We (Leo, Planet and I) all started as no trims, but snuck into a prison to free Mapicc. Mapicc
            then took Planet’s place in our trio.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            We accomplished tasks for the mafia to climb up the ranks. However, our task to become a gold trim was to
            kill Planet. After much insisting from Mapicc and Leo, I decided not to kill him, but it heavily dampened
            Ash’s trust, which led him to give me a secret mission: kill a player named Rose.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            When I found Rose,
            I thought she would be evil, but she was just a girl playing with her brother. But I had already made up my
            mind, and killed her with a dripstone trap. Ash was thoroughly impressed and gave me the rare opportunity to
            rank up to diamond trim. There were only 20 diamond trims on the entire server, and I had to fight for my
            spot.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            So with the help of Planet, Mapicc and Leo, we were able to rig the battle area by giving me extra effects.
            However, I eventually lost my invisibility, revealing to Ash who we really were. And when Ash had commanded
            that the diamond trim kill us, he was attacked instead. It turns out that the diamond player all along had
            been Minute protecting them, and as he told them to run, they had to warn all civilizations about the
            mafia’s arrival.

          </h3>
          <p>MrCube6 is widely known as a Minecraft Redstone Genius, being able to build anything he wants using
            Redstone. For some reason, he wants me dead, likely another assassin of the director.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">He somehow traps me in the BAT base, and after being saved by one of my teammates,
            Derapchu, Derap gets scolded by Leo for not noticing the trap immediately. Before hunting down Cube,
            Derapchu gets strapped to a bomb that the rest of us have to defuse. Leading to all of BAT’s riches getting
            stolen and Leo getting pissed at Derapchu, saying it was all his fault.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            BAT then spreads out to find the loot, with Derap and I going as a duo. Together we hunt down the riches,
            winning outnumbered fights against bandits and successfully getting the loot back.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            On the way back, Derap asks me to get all the credit for the items back, as he’s always the one who’s made
            fun of, to which I responded that he needs to show the others what he can do and believe in himself.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            When I outsmarted Cube’s final trap, Derap is the one who came to save me. Derap had finally contributed to
            the team and with Cube in a jail cell, he drops a book revealing a message from the director, as he
            disappears midair.

          </h3>
          <p>My teammates are some of the most Elite Minecraft Bounty Hunters on the entire server. They're experts at
            strategy, combat and player tracking. Yet for some reason, they now want me dead. The people who I have
            trusted the most have now turned on me, thinking I’m somehow the director, so I end up escaping.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">One of my teammates, Jumper, decides to give me a chance, figure out the truth and help me
            prove my innocence to the rest of BAT. So she sneaks me back in as an invisible spy and shows me the
            evidence against me, however the rest of BAT finds out and I have to run away.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            Jumper returns saying she wants me to listen in on a meeting, handing me some extra materials, and so I
            agree. But eventually I realized the meeting was a ploy in which Jumper betrayed me. Using the materials she
            had given me, I escaped. Jumper had outsmarted BAT to fake betraying me and earning back their trust.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            However, an invisible spy had heard all our plans, leading me to convince Jumper to kill them so that the
            rest of BAT wouldn’t know. With trust in Jumper once again, BAT witnessed my talk with the director, proving
            my innocence. But they had realized what Jumper had done by killing a spy and kicked her out of the team.
            They had kicked out the one member who had faith in me and who knows what’s coming next.

          <p class="ep-full">
            This was true, I was the reason we were being hunted, the reason his riches were now gone, and the reason
            his best friend died. So after apologizing and telling Leo that BAT was all I had when they decided to take
            a chance on me, Leo decided to spare me. To which I sent him away from the base as I too ran far away.

            Once they’re safe, the Director unveils themself to me revealing themself to be Wifies, my former best

          </h3>
          <p>I was returning to my camp on the Unstable SMP when I saw them, a group of players trying to steal my dog
            SMP. I followed them as far as I could until I saw it: a massive base home to the toxic clan. Knowing my
            wolf was inside I had no choice. I was going to destroy this toxic clan.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">Each clan specialized in using a different potion in combat, but I was able to adapt and
            kill them all. When Ashen’s life was threatened, I was forced to give up all my stuff and was launched into
            the air, expected to die once I hit the ground. But smuggling a few of my items with me and missing all my
            armor, I was able to survive the fall and kill the last enemy in my way. Ashen was safe.

          <p>I was on the Unstable SMP trying to find elytras since they are incredibly rare and can be sold for tons of
            items. But to get them, you need to go to the end, which typically wouldn’t be very hard but lately there’s
            been rumors of a player guarding the End, hoarding all the items that can be found there for himself.

          </h3>
          <p>Hidden millions of blocks out on our Minecraft server, Paragon was built by my friend to trap me forever.
            And even though it's considered perfect, I promise that someday, somehow, I'm going to escape.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">He demands I give him all my items, including the spyglass I had once given him long ago. I
            end up throwing the spyglass off the building and try killing Wifies, to which he teleports. While he
            disappears, I discreetly pick up the spyglass hoping he didn’t notice.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            Wifies pretends that everything between us is normal, and tells me that everything he does is for my own
            good, but I refuse to be trapped in this cage with him. I come to realize that to escape, I need him to
            believe I’ve given up so that I would run when he least expected it. However, he was smart, and after just a
            few tests, in which I tried killing him to end it once and for all, he had survived, making it clear that I
            hadn’t given up.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            Every single escape route was considered and it was hopeless to escape. He eventually demanded every block
            from my inventory, knowing the exact amount of each item I had, forcing both of us to step on pressure
            plates that would cause us both to explode if one of us stepped off, leading us to be together forever and
            for me to be safe, just like he wanted.
          </p>
          <p class="ep-full">
            But as I looked in my inventory, I dropped the spyglass on the pressure plate, saving my own life as I
            walked away. And in his last few moments, before the spyglass despawned, Wifies ran to hold it one last
            time, to feel his old sense of humanity before he had killed that version of him, as he died in mere
            seconds. I was free, but I had lost the best friend that had once always stood by my side.

            But after the team refused to work together on multiple occasions, I gave up the mission of killing Wemmbu
            and tried killing my team instead. So Wemmbu and I teamed together to fight people who were previously my
            teammates, and Jaden might have taken it more to heart than I thought.
