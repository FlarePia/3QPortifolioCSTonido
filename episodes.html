          <p class="ep-full">Together with the smartest player on the server, Wifies, we go through trials that test our teamwork and capabilities. But when time comes, when I have to pick the secret or Wifies, I pick the secret, which was the worst mistake I’ve ever made.</p>

          <p class="ep-full">Within the prisons of the Zam Empire are some people who are willing to help me break Wifies out. With each prison that Rek and I break into, there is a possibility of a new member joining our group. Once we’ve built up a strong enough team, we’ll break into the most protected prison to save Wifies once and for all.</p>

          <p class="ep-full">When Wifies and I were trapped in Clown’s circus, a team came to save us. We decided to stick with this team since they shared our interest in hunting Clownpierce. But eventually I decided to leave this team since they weren’t doing enough, and I joined a civilization where the citizens were doing everything they could to protect me and I realized my mistake.</p>

          <p>A few days ago, 5 of my best friends, as well as Clownpierce, all vanished. All that was left of them was a book with a set of coordinates. I have no idea where they went, but I’m going to find them.</p>
          <p class="ep-full">Wifies and I went on many quests to achieve these items that light up beacons. We were told that when we complete this, we would get our friends back. However throughout this project, we were sabotaged by Boosfer and his 2 goons: Kier and Dev, making this journey a lot harder. When we eventually completed the quests, we were face to face with Clownpierce, and I decided to give up my prized spyglass for a chance to see my friends again.          </p>

          <h3>Episode 6: Escaping Proton: Minecraft’s Most Secure Prison</h3>
          <p>This is the most secure prison in all of Minecraft. Nothing in here is certain except for one thing: if you get trapped, there’s no escape. But I promise that someday, somehow, I’m gonna break out.</p>
          <p class="ep-full">All 6 of us: Jumper, Derapchu, Kenadian, Rekrap, Wifies and I were all separated by pairs in 3 separate prisons and our pair was swapped every hour. We eventually found a way to communicate with each other in morse code, and broke out in a way the guards weren’t suspecting. However, Kenadian was the one who made the design of the prison and when they had a missing elytra, meaning only 5 could escape, he allowed the others to leave without him. When they eventually found his base, they were able to free him, making a successful escape for all 6 of them.</p>

          <p class="ep-full">Which is why far out in our server’s end dimension lies a city that Wifies and I created: a safe haven for any player trying to escape. We would gain members for this civilization, create strong defenses and assist players in need. But eventually, after defending this city for so long, we were ambushed and had no choice but to leave this city we’ve made behind.

          <p>After our heist went wrong, we were trapped inside the walls of a massive mining city. Forced to collect diamond blocks until the end of time by the head of this place named Reddoons, we have one goal: escape.</p>
          <p class="ep-full">Dean, Wifies and I then took diamond blocks from the inner city and gave them to the other miners inside the city so that they too could escape. Eventually we came face to face with the player, Ashwagg, the leader of the invis mafia. When he invited the 3 of us to the mafia as we would be great assets to the team, we teleported away. Safe…. For now.

          <h3>Episode 9: The Search for Minecraft’s FarLands</h3>
          <p>Millions of blocks out on our Minecraft server, there is rumored to be a city that lies in a strange place called the FarLands.</p>
          <p class="ep-full">With the Mafia quickly taking over our server, Wifies, Dean and I must find this city with this compass to try and build an army to fight back. As we struggle with being hunted by mafia members on our mission, Wifies and Dean aren’t getting along. It’s eventually revealed that the reason they kept being tracked by the mafia was because Dean was leaking their location. So after kicking Dean out of the team, Parrot and Wifies move forward to the farlands. But once they were so close, Wifies burned the compass saying that this was for our safety. Feeling betrayed, I continued on to the farlands on my own, and hoped to see him there. I won’t stop my journey just to save myself because the server needs my help.

          <h3>Episode 10: Unstable SMP: The First War</h3>
          <p>The mafia is growing faster than ever, destroying every last civilization that stands in their way. If we don’t stop them soon, it’s going to be too late.</p>
          <p class="ep-full">As I try to rise in the ranks of the Farlands, I realize just how corrupt the Warrior faction is. So I work together with the farmer faction to prove to the warriors that we need everyone’s help in this war against the Mafia. So once I became overall head of the Warrior faction, I sent everyone on their respective missions. On one of these missions, I killed Dean because I didn’t realize he had rejoined the Mafia to backstab them just to gain back my trust. Once I spoke to Ash face to face, he told me his next target was the FarLands and that in 2 - 3 days, it would belong to him.
